# Standard Deviation and Variance Extension for SQLite

This code implements `stddev` (standard deviation) and `variance` functions as an extension for the SQLite database. It allows you to calculate these statistical measures for both sample and population data, supporting both aggregate and window function contexts.

## How It Works

The extension provides functions to calculate the standard deviation and variance of a set of numeric values. It is designed to work efficiently as both an aggregate function (calculating the statistic over an entire group) and a window function (calculating the statistic over a defined window frame).

### Key Features:

-   **Sample vs. Population:** Distinct functions are provided for calculating sample statistics (using `n-1` in the denominator, applying Bessel's correction for unbiased estimation) and population statistics (using `n` in the denominator).
-   **Window Function Support:** Optimized for window functions using a circular buffer, allowing for efficient O(1) updates as the window slides. This means adding a new value and removing an old value from the window can be done in constant time.
-   **Aliases:** For convenience, multiple aliases are registered for each function (e.g., `stddev`, `stdev`, `stddev_samp`, `variance`, `var`, `var_samp`, etc.). Both lowercase and uppercase versions of the primary function names are supported.
-   **Efficient Calculation:** Maintains a running sum and sum of squares of values within the current context (group or window) to derive variance and standard deviation.

## Compilation and Loading

To use this extension, you first need to compile it into a shared library.

### Prerequisites

Before compiling, you must have the SQLite development libraries installed, which provide the necessary header files (like `sqlite3.h`).

-   **On Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install sqlite3-dev`
-   **On Fedora/CentOS:** `sudo dnf install sqlite-devel`
-   **On macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew install sqlite`
-   **On Windows:** Ensure your compiler (like MinGW-w64) has access to the SQLite source code or pre-compiled headers.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o sqlite-stddev-extension.so sqlite-stddev-extension.c -lm
```

### Windows

To compile on Windows, you can use a compiler like MinGW-w64 (GCC).

```bash
gcc -shared -o sqlite-stddev-extension.dll sqlite-stddev-extension.c -lm
```

### Loading the Extension

Once compiled, you can load the extension in your SQLite session:

```sql
-- On Linux/macOS
.load ./sqlite-stddev-extension.so

-- On Windows
.load ./sqlite-stddev-extension.dll
```

## Usage

The `stddev` and `variance` functions are available as aggregate functions and window functions. They are registered under various names and aliases.

### Syntax

#### Aggregate Function Syntax

```sql
FUNCTION_NAME(numeric_value)
```

#### Window Function Syntax

```sql
FUNCTION_NAME(numeric_value) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... ROWS BETWEEN ...)
```

### Arguments

1.  `numeric_value` (numeric): The numeric value for which to calculate the statistic.

## Examples

Let's assume we have a `measurements` table with the following data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurements (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  value REAL
);

INSERT INTO measurements (value) VALUES
(10), (12), (15), (13), (18), (20), (22), (25), (23), (28);
```

### Aggregate Function Examples

#### Sample Standard Deviation

Calculates the sample standard deviation for all values in the `measurements` table.

```sql
SELECT stddev_samp(value) AS sample_stddev
FROM measurements;
```

#### Population Standard Deviation

Calculates the population standard deviation for all values in the `measurements` table.

```sql
SELECT stddev_pop(value) AS population_stddev
FROM measurements;
```

#### Sample Variance

Calculates the sample variance for all values in the `measurements` table.

```sql
SELECT variance_samp(value) AS sample_variance
FROM measurements;
```

#### Population Variance

Calculates the population variance for all values in the `measurements` table.

```sql
SELECT variance_pop(value) AS population_variance
FROM measurements;
```

### Window Function Examples

#### Rolling Sample Standard Deviation

Calculates the sample standard deviation for a rolling window of the current row and the thirty preceding rows, ordered by `id`.

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  value,
  stddev_samp(value) OVER (
    ORDER BY id
    ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_sample_stddev
FROM measurements;
```

#### Rolling Population Variance

Calculates the population variance for a rolling window of the current row and the thirty preceding rows, ordered by `id`.

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  value,
  variance_pop(value) OVER (
    ORDER BY id
    ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_population_variance
FROM measurements;
```

## Limitations

-   **Minimum Data Points:**
    -   Sample standard deviation and variance functions (`stddev_samp`, `variance_samp`, and their aliases) require at least two data points. If fewer than two points are available, they will return `NULL`.
    -   Population standard deviation and variance functions (`stddev_pop`, `variance_pop`, and their aliases) require at least one data point. If no points are available, they will return `NULL`.
-   **Data Type:** Only numeric values (INTEGER or REAL) are supported. Non-numeric values will result in an error.
-   **NULL Handling:** `NULL` values in the input are ignored and do not contribute to the calculation. If all values in a group or window are `NULL`, the result will be `NULL`.
-   **NaN/Infinity:** Results that are Not-a-Number (NaN) or Infinity (INF) will be returned as `NULL` by SQLite. This can occur in edge cases, such as attempting to calculate standard deviation from a single data point (for sample) or from a set of identical values (for variance where the sum of squares might lead to floating point issues if not handled carefully).
